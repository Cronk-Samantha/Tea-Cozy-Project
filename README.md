# Tea-Cozy-Project

**DISCLAIMER: The images, content, and design came from codecademy.com as one of the available projects.

The goal of this project was to build a site from the beginning while following the design spec that was given to me. Using flex, margin, padding, and nesting div's, I was able to create distinct sections of the page while keeping everything centered and making sure I had a solid page flow. I enjoyed creating this site because I had to problem-solve and troubleshoot on my own while still having a general guide (the design spec) of where all the elements needed to be. This is not a real company and building this was purely for practice and gave me a ton of hands on experience with styling.
